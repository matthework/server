    The cost of cyber-crime for the global economy has been estimated at $445 billion annually. Cyber espionage and stealing individuals' personal information is believed to have affected more than 800 million people during 2013. Financial losses from cyber-theft could cause as many as 150,000 Europeans to lose their jobs, according to a report conducted by internet security company McAfee. Cyber-crime damages trade between nations, competitiveness, innovation, and global economic growth, and slows the pace of global innovation. McAfee is calling for governments to begin a serious, systematic effort to collect and publish data on cyber-crime to help countries and companies make better choices about risk and policy.
